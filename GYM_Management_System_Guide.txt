📌 Project Title: GYM Management System
==============================

🎯 Problem Statement:
Traditional gyms rely on paper-based billing and manual notifications, which are hard to manage and easy to lose. This system will digitize all receipts and automate communication, ensuring efficient operations and user convenience.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Firebase (Backend/Database & Authentication)
- Firebase Hosting (Deployment - optional)

📈 Difficulty Level: Medium

🌐 Domain: Sports / Fitness Tech

==============================
🧩 MODULE BREAKDOWN
==============================

🔹 ADMIN MODULE
- Login authentication
- Add, update, and delete members
- Create bills and assign fee packages
- Monthly fee notifications to members
- Export financial reports
- Manage supplement store data
- Manage diet/nutrition information

🔹 MEMBER MODULE
- Secure login
- View payment receipts
- View upcoming bill notifications

🔹 USER MODULE
- Login
- View member details
- Search member records

==============================
⚙️ FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS
==============================

✔ Modular Codebase: 
- Write reusable, structured functions/components
- Follow best practices for naming and structure

✔ Safe & Testable Code:
- Include proper validations and error handling
- Use mock data or unit tests to ensure reliability

✔ Maintainability:
- Use comments and structured folders
- Keep logic separated for scalability

✔ Portability:
- Ensure the project runs on any standard browser and Firebase environment

==============================
🧾 DATABASE & LOGGING
==============================

✔ Firebase:
- Use Firestore or Realtime DB for storing receipts, user info, payments, etc.
- Firebase Auth for login

✔ Logging:
- Implement logging for each critical action (e.g., login attempts, bill generation)
- Use JavaScript console or logging libraries

==============================
🚀 DEPLOYMENT & HOSTING
==============================

✔ Deployment Options:
- Firebase Hosting (recommended)
- GitHub Pages (alternative, if only frontend)

✔ GitHub:
- Maintain public GitHub repository
- Include a complete README file with:
  • Features
  • Tech stack
  • Setup instructions
  • Sample data or demo GIF

==============================
📊 OPTIMIZATION & TESTING
==============================

✔ Code Optimization:
- Avoid redundant DOM queries
- Optimize Firebase reads/writes
- Lazy-load assets where possible

✔ Testing:
- Manual test cases for each module
- Add a test section in your README

==============================
✅ SUBMISSION CHECKLIST
==============================

✔ GitHub Repository (public)
✔ Project Code (HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase config)
✔ README with setup, screenshots, features
✔ Project Report (PDF or .docx as per format)
✔ Mentioned design, optimization, and logging approach

==============================
📚 LEARNING OUTCOME
